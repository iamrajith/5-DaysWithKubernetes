# 4. Updating a Deployment

Updating a Kubernetes deployment involves modifying the configuration of an existing deployment. We'll explore two methods for updating deployments: directly editing the YAML file and using the `kubectl apply` command.

## 4.1 Directly Editing the YAML File

1. **Open the Deployment YAML File**:
   - Use the following command to open the YAML configuration of the deployment in your default editor:
     ```bash
     kubectl edit deployment my-deployment
     ```
   - This command will open the deployment configuration for `my-deployment`.

2. **Make Changes**:
   - Navigate to the `spec.template.spec.containers` section.
   - Update the image version or any other desired fields.
   - Save the file and exit the editor.

3. **Apply the Changes**:
   - The changes you made in the YAML file will be applied to the deployment using the following command:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f my-deployment.yaml
     ```

## 4.2 Using `kubectl apply`

1. **Update the YAML File**:
   - Modify the deployment YAML file directly (as described in the previous step).

2. **Apply the Changes**:
   - Use the `kubectl apply` command to apply the updated configuration:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f my-deployment.yaml
     ```

Remember to replace placeholders (e.g., `my-deployment`, `nginx:1.15.0`) with your actual values. ðŸš€
